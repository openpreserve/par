## Roadmap
The priorities associated with each area of development are in the process of being further defined as is the finite detail associated with each release to move PAR from its current version, 0.3 to a production version 1.0.

The roadmap breaks down into three distinct categories, each has one or more specific development areas:

1. Data model
2. Tools
3. Integration

### Data Model
The data model is the core component of PAR that describes the elements of preservation policies implemented using machine readable data structures. The data model describes attribute such as:
* Preservation actions that can be performed on digital content
* The tools that would be needed to perform the desired actions
* File formats
* Policy statements

The model has now matured sufficiently in terms of what can be done but further effort is needed to define what it could do and what itâ€™s limitations might be. This will continue to be a key focus area for the team.

### Tools
The main tool components include: 

**Sync tool** that will enable preservation actions to be copied between systems. Work on the sync tools has not as yet started

**Registry browser** the prototype browser requires further work to make it production ready

**Register editing tool** this will enable users to update their own registry, work has not started on its build 

**Client GUI tool**

### Integration
Integtaion includes:

**API extensions** the API is already well formed, further planned enhancements include items such as:
* identity management

**Trusted source integration**
* Wikidp
* Other trusted sources / end points as identified

**Vendor DP systems**
* Integration of other vendor DP systems
